# Welcome to my Stackathon Project: Pokemaps!

Pokemaps is a passion project of mine that was born out of my desire to create something fun and nostalgic from my childhood love for Pokemon. It brings together the resources of OpenWeatherAPI, PokemonAPI, and React to offer users an exciting experience of catching Pokemon in real-time! With Pokemaps, users can view the current location and weather data, which dynamically generates and displays Pokemon in that area. The app provides a fun and interactive way for users to catch and collect Pokemon as they explore different locations, whether it's a sunny day in a park or a rainy day in the city. Thanks to the real-time data provided by OpenWeatherAPI, users can expect to encounter different Pokemon types based on the weather conditions. The user interface is designed with React, making it responsive, intuitive, and easy to use. I hope you have as much enjoyment playing with Pokemaps as I did creating it!
